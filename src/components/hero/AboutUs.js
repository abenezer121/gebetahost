                     <h5>
            Who started the company?</h5>
            <p>
What started the company was the non stop inconvenience in finding time to eat while waiting for the food to come after ordering, which greatly affected our punctuality and study time. So 2 of the founders one day running late for class whilst looking for a descent place to eat, said enough is enough and took matters into our own hands, tolked with our close friends, the co founders and that was how Gebeta was Born.</p>
<h5>When was it started? </h5>
<p>The idea was started about over a year ago. Due to pressure from class and various unforseen circumstances, the development was delayed.</p>
<h2>Where was it started? </h2>
<p>It was started at the University where we currently go, Addis Ababa Science and Technology University.</p>
<h2>Why was it started? What need was it filling? </h2>
<p>(For example, no one was offering these in quite this way, or no one was offering what ours do, or nobody else offered products made by hand, and so on.)
It started, simply because we saw a problem first hand, suffered first hand, and said lets fix it while making something for ourselves.</p>
<h2>How did the company get its name? </h2>
<p>Originally, we started us AfriGebeta, we were taking part in the African Innovation Week at the time, Then later came to Gebeta, since we thought the name would be befitting the service we provide in a familiar way to the customers.</p>
<h2>Value proposition </h2>
<p>Our service comes through the simplest platforms and ways, and yet provides a great service, with the pandemic and all people want, no, need this kind of service where the can avoid crowds, stay home and order whatever they want. Meaning staying healthy and safe whilst conveniently getting a delivery service. </p>
<h2>Mission. Vision and future</h2>
<p>The team, if all goes well, wishes to create a platform that facilitates online ordering and delivery, but not only food and drinks, we also wish to expand to giving the service supermarkets and shops too and much more.</p>
